ChatGPT uses

- Understand what typical `pharmacist workflows` are.
- Get types of drugs for PICC and PIV
- Generate date format funcs
- After creating data structures and mocking data to get UI built, used ChatGPT to help me build a function to generate data. So I can easily have more than 2 or 3 visits for a patient. Specifically the `generateVisits` func in `src/db/Visits`.
- Generate get patient age func
- Help pick colors for charts

Libraries

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
